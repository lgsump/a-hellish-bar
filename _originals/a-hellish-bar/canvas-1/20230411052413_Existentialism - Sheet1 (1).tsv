0	16	NARRATOR: On a fine Tuesday afternoon, a lovely group of academics, self-proclaimed “Existentialists”, finish up their work at the nearby conference. Having had enough human interaction for the day, the gang finally separate themselves from the others in an attempt to have a drink.	Transcript
17	26	Bea: How does this place look? “The Hellish Bar”? Sounds rather dull. Fits you nicely, Kay. And you, Enne, now that I think about it.	Transcript
26.1	26.5	Kay: How funny.	Transcript
27.1	27.9	Enne [completely unamused, rolling his eyes]: Hmph.	Transcript
27.2	28	The group walks into the bar, there is a ringing of the bell, announcing to the staff of their arrival. They all sit down at a nearby table, all looking around, noticing that they are the only ones in the store.	Transcript
28	33	Haytch: Well, I sure hope there is at least enough staff here to get us some drinks!	Transcript
28.3	29	[Quick laughter from everyone (besides Cee and Enne).]	Transcript
33	35	Cee [French accent, said with a layer of mystery and performance]: The mist beyond the sea grows close to shore.	Transcript
36	39	Ess [French accent]: Right, right… Does anyone know his deal?	Transcript
40	51.5	Bea [argumentative with French accent as well]: Oh, come on old friend, how has this not become obvious to you already! He only speaks in riddles to embrace this hideous reality. He gets it, unlike you cranky, serious academics! [laughing and saying jokingly]	Transcript
52	60	Ess [rolling eyes with tone]: Agh! Whatever. Enough of that. I just find it weird, even knowing him for years.	Transcript
61	63	Haytch [German]: The French and their drama.	Transcript
61.2	62	Swiftly as Haytch begins to rant about the French, the bartender comes out from the back and comes up to them and their table near the bar.	Transcript
64	69	Bartender: Hello, welcome to “The Hellish Bar”. What can I get y’all to start?	Transcript
68.9	70	Kay [quickly after]: I’ll take a coffee.	Transcript
71	74	Bea: A coffee? At a bar? What is your problem? [Begins to laugh]	Transcript
75	85	Enne: He is old and religious yet completely void of looking at his problem for what it is, what else do you need to answer that question. For me, water.	Transcript
85.1	85.9	Kay: Demon!	Transcript
87	88	Enne: Right.	Transcript
88.5	92	Bea [quietly to Ess]: Well, they make us look friendly! What is their history?	Transcript
92.1	96	Ess [whispering back to Bea]: They don’t even know each other! Just rivals from different times.	Transcript
96.2	98	Bea: How depressing…	Transcript
99	100	Ess [in agreement and to extend her comment]: … they are.	Transcript
101	102	Haytch: I’ll have some wine.	Transcript
103	110	Ess [in response]: Oh la la, will be getting to see your true self tonight, Haytch? Normally, you don’t come to things like this.	Transcript
110	114	Haytch: Hopefully not, and I usually don’t come because you all bring out the worst in me.	Transcript
114.2	121	Ess [in disappointment]: Oh, come on, old friend. We (and that wine!) bring out your true self! Don’t blame us!	Transcript
121.2	123	Haytch: Agh!	Transcript
123	135	Bea: Okay, enough, let’s give the poor boy our orders so he can get along without our nuisance. I’ll take the strongest you can give me, I’m ready to party!	Transcript
136	138	Ess: Same here.	Transcript
136.2	137	Both Enne and Kay look at them in disgust until they realize they are both doing the same thing, then being quiet again.	Transcript
138	140	Kay: Oh, come on… It’s a Tuesday.[quick stop when they realize in sync with Enne]	Transcript
140	141	Enne: Bleach my eyes… [quick stop when they realize in sync with Kay]	Transcript
146	150	Cee: [interrupting the silence]: So it was with me as I peacefully died of my cure.	Transcript
150	152	Bea: He’ll have water.	Transcript
152	154	Bartender: Of course, I’ll be right back.	Transcript
155	168	Ess [Before the Bartender could walk away]: Wait! Could you explain why no one else is here? I don’t hear anything behind the doors, the quiet is so filling. Could you break your role for one second and give me some clarity?	Transcript
168	178	Bartender [a little frantically]: Well, sir, I’m not sure. I’m just a bartender, so I don’t really pay attention to what goes on in the kitchen and back, but I guess it has been a little slow out front.	Transcript
179	193	Ess [sassily]: Agh, come on, you are not just a bartender! Anyways, one second– [turning towards the group] Do you guys want to try for somewhere else? This place is a little too creepy and quiet for me. How about the outdoor patio on the corner, it looked lovely.	Transcript
179.2	180	Kay and Enne rolling their eyes, Haytch somewhat in agreement, but also realizing that it just meant pushing the social event on for more time.	Transcript
194	197	Bea: No, yeah, I agree. This place does feel a bit off.	Transcript
199	204	Haytch [finally able to find a place in his agreement]: You and your French feelings! This is where you fail to realize and start your discussion!	Transcript
205	216	Ess: Oh, so this is really why you came here today! You wanted to push your silly little disagreement about how I started my writing assuming the minds of others. You really are unable to see yourself beyond your profession!	Transcript
216	217	Bea [in correction]: Silly! Silly profession.	Transcript
218	228	Ess: Agh, yes, silly profession indeed. Anyways, Mr. Bartender, or really whatever your name is, you shouldn’t have to worry about our orders because we have decided on elsewhere.	Transcript
228	233	Bartender: No worries, y’all have a nice night!	Transcript
233	239	VOID SOUNDS	Transcript
233.2	234	The group gets up, pushing in chairs, and Bea heads the pack towards the door. As they mutter along to the front, Bea opens the door to find a mysterious, magical void that encompasses the world beyond the door.	Transcript
241	242	Bea: Oh my goodness!	Transcript
244	245	Kay: Great Heavens.	Transcript
246	247	Bea: What on earth is that!	Transcript
247	249	Haytch: I’m sure it is not from Earth!	Transcript
247.2	248	They back away from the void, and situate themselves at the nearest table and bar, all still looking at the void in awe.	Transcript
249	258	Cee: He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.	Transcript
259	262	Ess: Ah, now is not the time for your games and poetry, Cee!	Transcript
264	274	Bartender: Hold on, let me see if the telephone still works! [He attempts to run to the back/kitchen but finds, there, another void] Nevermind, all the exits of this room are met with the void…	Transcript
275	284	Haytch: Not to sound like I’m subverting the importance of how meaningful this event is, but what I find odd is how skin-like the void looks, and the seeming silence it so loudly exerts.	Transcript
275.3	278	They all look at Haytch and give a moment of silence, as if in awe.	Transcript
285	294	Bea: Haytch… the void is most definitely not skin-like? I mean, I can’t really describe it, and maybe describing it is harmful in itself.	Transcript
295	298	Ess: Well, maybe it is more a reflection of parts of ourselves.	Transcript
299	312	Enne: Oh, you’re full of it. Your presentation at the conference is over, no need to let your ideology bleed into this real situation! Also, it’s just completely black…	Transcript
313	321	Ess: Agh! Now who is full of it! What do you ramage about in your lectures if not for your attempt at making some truth. It is the right thing to do.	Transcript
322	331	Enne: Right? If anything, events like these prove that “right” is just a historical reflection. Much more reflective of where and who you are than this void!	Transcript
333	337	Haytch: This confused and manipulated attempt at small talk is killing me, let’s not just talk to talk!	Transcript
338	351	Kay: Oh, alright, let’s just really take in what is going on. Stop shouting at each other, and attempt to make sense of it, or recognize its senselessness, to find what we should do.	Transcript
338.2	339	A moment of silence falls upon the group, they all reflect amongst themselves, when Kay gets up and walks towards the void and stands up close to it.	Transcript
352	356	Bea [with concern]: Kay, what are you doing! Get back from there.	Transcript
356	358	Bartender [whispering to Ess]: Does he know what he’s doing?	Transcript
358	362	Ess [whispering back]: Nope. That’s kinda his thing.	Transcript
362	374	Kay [turned around to face the group]: Something is telling me that this is the way out… I’m not completely sure, but I, now, can’t justify my external reasons to do or not do it. I have faith…[he says as he falls backward into the void]	Transcript
374	378	VOID SOUNDS	Transcript
380	392	Haytch [breaking the silence after he left]: He definitely got something right, even if it was driven by madness. Being here with you all is something of which I need to escape as well! I will call it being-for-and-against-itself-in-with-the-world!	Transcript
393	395	Bea: Real sweet, Haytch.	Transcript
395	396	Enne: You and those terms…	Transcript
397	414	Haytch: Well, you all, like I’ve already mentioned, always bring out the worst in me. Though, I see myself through you, I see where I start and you end. I [he gets up and walks to the void] know one thing for certain, and that is that this is not authentic. So, what better reason to think that this is not where I am meant to be [he walks, head-first, into the void.]	Transcript
415	418	VOID SOUNDS	Transcript
421	427	Ess: Well, I, for one, am not surprised. He was always so dramatic about being social.	Transcript
427	434	Cee: In order to keep faith with ourselves, we are obliged to respect in you what you do not respect in others.	Transcript
435	441	Bea [while laughing]: How beautiful, Cee. Keep them coming, oh, how I love seeing Ess’ face when you speak!	Transcript
442	463	Enne: I think Cee, like you both, has something of importance in his literary jungle of jargon. Something integral to this question yet completely against it. What we should do, or what we might collectively think, is just a combination of your subjective points. We all, then, have the desire to take control of our lives. Naturally.	Transcript
463	465	Bea: Well, don’t get too general on us…	Transcript
465	472	Ess: No, no, no. We are all responsible for our own experience and our own situation.	Transcript
473	478	Enne: Agh, you put too much weight on your freedom. You should embrace your will to control–	Transcript
479	481	Cee [interrupting Enne]: You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.	Transcript
482	501	Bea [amused]: How fitting of a riddle, I could barely notice it! But you do make some sense, but I think even with that statement you, yourself, are making too much of a claim! We need to recognize that we all are experiencing this event differently, we all, for example, don’t even perceive the same void! We should embrace what each of us brings to the table.	Transcript
502	505	Bartender [setting down more drinks, beginning to make a joke]: Even if it is quite literally just the drinks.	Transcript
506	520	Ess [with real concern]: Son, you need to rid yourself of this. You are seemingly in a voidless reality, where it is just the likes of me, you, and these others. You are rejecting your freedom by living completely in your present! And even worse, now, your past!	Transcript
521	527	Bartender: But, nothing I will do will change my future course… might as well give y’all the drinks in hopes that y’all figure something out.	Transcript
528	535	Ess [with a chuckle]: Well, we can agree on one thing, nothing will determine your future, but that is its beauty! That is your freedom, it’s your possibility.	Transcript
546	554	Bea: Not sure exactly what he’s on about, but what he definitely has some point is that you do have to recognize your own freedom. You can make those drinks, you can jump into the void, or you could punch Ess in the face. If we are taking votes on which one, I cast mine for the latter.	Transcript
555	556	Ess: Oh, you— I’m! Ugh.	Transcript
556	560	They all laugh for a bit.	Transcript
568	572	Bartender [breaking the silence]: Well, I suppose you are right to some extent… and I think I have an idea.	Transcript
573	576	SOUNDS OF PICKING UP THE PHONE	Transcript
573.2	576	He grabs the phone and shuffles it around to make the noise obvious that he grabbed the recording, and then finally, ending the radio play, says:	Transcript
576	578	Bartender: What if I just stop recording?	Transcript
