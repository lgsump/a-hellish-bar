Also, once again, either to fault or quirk, we establish her criticism of seriousness in order to add comedic relief, again adding to the historic and personable relationship and friendly conflict she had with Sartre.",

Firstly, it was important to us that the Bartender is the one that <i>truly</i> recognizes the facticity in the sense that he recognized himself as being withing a play. So, we thought this best exemplified Sartre's understanding of the paradox of how facticity is what brings about freedom in the sense that his <i>true</i> understanding of his situation then allowed him to make the ultimate, <i>free</i> decision to leave the play. It also makes many commentaries about what Sartre was on when discussing the idea of role, as not only was he playing a role as the Bartender in the bar, but he was playing the literal role of Bartender in the play. So, by truly recognizing himself beyond his role in the play, there were also parallels to him truly accepting it in that sense as well.",
