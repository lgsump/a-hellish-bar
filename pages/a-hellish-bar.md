<h2><b>Character quirks and key:</b></h2>
<hr>
<h4> This is key is used to set a tone for the characters due to the lack of ability to show emotion in the recording. These are also personable ways in which we read each of the philosophers, not necessarily how they really were. 
  <hr>
<h4>Bea: [Beauvoir] Comedic relief, glue to transitions, and constantly in friendly battle with Ess.  
<br>
Ess: [Sartre] Fixation on the bartender and his role to play in it all, and is constantly in battle with Bea. 
<br>
Enne: [Nietzsche] Depressing, constant battling with Kay. 
<br>
Kay: [Kierkegaard] Connects everything to God, and ultimately takes his “leap” of faith. 
<br>
Haytch: [Heidegger] Cranky and old. Has a affinity to creating new words and using lots of hyphens. 
<br>
Cee: [Camus] Speaks completely in prose, some believe he isn’t saying anything of use. 
<br>
Bartender: [Us] Southern, unnamed, regular, and a worker who has no idea what is going on, he is relatively quiet and just brings around drinks for the other characters, but his own understanding of self is both intentionally complex and unintentionally, yet fruitfully, questionable.

  Side note, the voices were done by <a href="Murf.ai">Murf.ai</a>, so the tones of voices were not completely what would be desirable, so make sure to check with the script to see if there is a tone indicator. The layers are labelled "Transcript" and <font color="green">"Commentary"</font>, in green, to separate the different types of annotations. Also, there are some issues with timing regarding the transcript, and those are things that are still being developed in the AudiAnnotate program itself, but the time should be relatively close.
