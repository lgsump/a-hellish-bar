<center><h1><b>A HELLISH BAR</b></h1></center>
<hr>
<br>
<h4><center>A group of friends walk into a bar and suddenly realize they aren’t where they think they are, so they attempt to make sense of their reality, one-by-one.

  <h3><b>The project:</b></h3>
  <br>
  <br>
<h4>-  A radio play (completely audio) of the screenplay that you are about to see
  <br>
  <br>
-  Annotations created to explain small choices, allowing for an educational and creative engagement with the play. 
<br>
  <hr>
  <h3><b>Project outlines to the prompt:</b></h3>
  <br>
  <br>
<h4>Seriously engage with the philosophies of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus. 
  <br>
  <br>
-  Uses them as characters, both using their philosophies and our interpretations of them as people.
  <br>
  <br>
Convey the practical usefulness of existentialism in the everyday lives of your audience.
  <br>
  <br>
-  Making fun of the common idea that existentialism isn’t exactly helpful to anyone, especially considering all of the characters in the play die, with the turnaround of the bartender showing us how we take them and continue to live. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Do this in an appealing (and ideally witty) way, so that it would serve well as a means of popularizing existentialism.
It is a satire
  <br>
  <br>
-  A radio play, meant to be a literary thing, but also put and annotated on AudiAnnotate, making it able for the little choices to be analyzed and explained so that the messages hit home.

  <h3><b>Description of the radio play:<b>
  <br>
  <br>
<h4>Characters Bea, Ess, Enne, Kay, Haytch, and Cee walk into a bar. It is meant to be set up as the common idea of “So X and Y walk into a bar” set-up as a type of joke. The problem they face is that they thought they entered a bar, but when they realized something was wrong and attempted to leave, they saw an indescribable void. So, it is up to all of them and the bartender to make sense of this and figure out what they should do.
